# ErgoDash PCB Plate

![PCB Stack](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dinosaurkeyboards/dinosaurkeyboards.github.io/master/img/pcb.jpg)

## Why did I make this?
After getting a bunch of [ErgoDash](https://github.com/omkbd/ErgoDash) PCBs printed, I realized I wasn't satisfied with a 3D printed plate. While I could print in any color, I loved the fit and finish of a manufactered plate much more. With that thought in my mind, I decided to create a plate to fit my needs.

## How can I use this?
You can get these printed from sites like https://jlcpcb.com/ (which is where I get all of my PCBs from). I was able to get 30 plates printed for $80 DHL shipped.

## What's included?
- Gerber file
- .brd file for use in Eagle
